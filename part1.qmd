# Statistics and Data {#sec-part1}

What is Statistics? What is Data Science? What are data? I bet you have heard about data science quite often these days. In fact, data science is a quite new buzzword that was not that popular early 21th century. Even now I don't think there is a formal and clear definition of data science. In my opinion, data science is such a broad area and subject that anything techniques related to data could be viewed as a part of data science, and this book is by no means a comprehensive data science book covering every aspect of dealing with data.

While data science is hot and fancy, statistics is a dull and old word that has been used for centuries. Believe or not, by the 18th century the term statistics is used to describe the systematic collection of demographic and economic data by state [^1], and in mathematics, statistics, or be more formally statistical inference [^2], is the process of using data analysis to infer properties of a population. Without doubt statistics plays an important role in lots of aspects of data no matter what data science is and how data science evolves.

This part, **Statistics and Data** (Chapters 1 through 7), builds the foundation for everything that follows. We introduce what data are, why we collect them, how we summarize them, and how model based thinking helps us make reliable conclusions from data. Across Chapters 1 to 7, we build a foundation for doing statistics as **learning about unknowns from data under uncertationty using statistical model**. 

Moreover, we also learn about the computing software we will be using for the rest of the book. When I was a college student, I learned statistics with some paper and pens, doing all the calculations by hand or a calculator. We won't do that anymore and you should not because every company or institution is doing statistical analysis using computer software, whatever that is.

## Big ideas in this Part

### What is data

In statistics, data are recorded values that represent information about individuals, objects, or events of interest. We will discuss:

- How statistics views data as measurements with variability

- How data are generated, including studies, surveys, and experiments

- Where data come from, including observation, administrative records, sensors, and digital traces

### Why we need data

Statistics, machine learning, and data science all rely on data because data provide information about what we are curious about, and connect questions to *evidence*. We will discuss:

- Why data are necessary for description, comparison, explanation, prediction, and decision making

- How the purpose of the analysis shapes what data we need and how we collect them

### Summarizing data

Raw data are often too detailed to interpret directly, so we use summaries to reveal patterns and variability. We will discuss:

- Why we summarize data

- Why we choose particular summaries, such as graphs and numerical summaries

- How summaries support our goals, such as comparing groups or understanding relationships

### Model-based thinking

The book is model-based statistics. We will discuss:

- What it means to treat data as coming from a probabilistic model, or a data-generating process.

- How models help us separate signal from noise, quantify uncertainty, and generalize beyond a sample
