## What is Statistics?

The first question we ask in this book is "What is Statistics?"

Statistics can be defined in a variety of ways, and there doesn't seem to be one definition that describes it best. For our purposes, statistics can be generally divided into two overarching categories:
  - Statistics as a set of numeric records
  - Statistics as a discipline

In ordinary conversations, the word **statistics** is used as a term to indicate a set or collection of **numeric records**. For example, fig-mj-stats below shows Michael Jordan's career statistics from his time in the NBA.  However, this is just one way of defining statistics.
